@article{Liu2018b,
   abstract = {The reliability and performance of additive manufacturing (AM) machines affect the product quality and manufacturing cost. Developing effective health monitoring and prognostics methods is critical to AM productivity. Yet limited work is done on machine health monitoring. Recently, the application of acoustic emission sensor (AE) to the fault diagnosis of material extrusion or fused deposition modeling process was demonstrated. One challenge in real-time process monitoring is processing the large amount of data collected by high-fidelity sensors for diagnostics and prognostics. In this paper, the efficiency of machine state identification from AE data is significantly improved with reduced feature space dimension. In the proposed method, features extracted in both time and frequency domains are combined and then reduced with the linear discriminant analysis. An unsupervised density based clustering method is applied to classify and recognize different machine states of the extruder. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively identify machine states of the extruder even within a much smaller feature space.},

@article{Wendt2017,
   abstract = {In a previous work, dumbbell specimens were shown to be inadequate for the tensile testing of Additive Manufacturing monolayers. Finite Element Method (FEM) has been used in this contribution for comparing tensile-stress distributions in both conventional and rectangular samples. Different extrusion paths for the manufacturing via Fused Layer Modelling (FLM) were taken into account. The calculations showed stress concentrations in the dumbbell type specimens in the zone of variable width away from the gauge length. The results were used for explaining the differences between mechanical behavior of dumbbell and rectangular specimens made with FLM from Poly-Lactic Acid (PLA). The mechanical behavior in the experiments closely matches the FEM results. At least 20 % of the tested dumbbell specimens fractured away from the gauge length, compromising the resulting tensile strength data. Rectangular tensile test specimens are proposed as a better alternative.},
