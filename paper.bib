   abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has been played a crucial role in the fourth industrial revolution. Sensor-based monitoring technologies are essential in detecting defects and providing feedback for process control. Acoustic emission (AE) sensors have been used for long time in a wide range of processes and fields, but they are still a challenge in AM processes. This work presents a study on the AE signals in the time-domain - raw and root mean square (RMS) values - regarding their behavior during the manufacturing of a single-layer part in the Fused Filament Fabrication process for two infill patterns. Tests were conducted in a Cartesian 3D printer using Polylactic Acid material. The AE sensor was attached to the printer table through a magnetic coupling, and the signal was collected by an oscilloscope at 1 MHz sampling frequency. It was found that the raw AE signals behaved quite differently not just for the two infill patterns, but within the same pattern. The raw and RMS AE signals contain many spikes along the whole process, but the higher ones were those generally occurring at the end and/or start of a fabrication line. The RMS values, however, was useful for finding the start and end times of each fabricated line for both patterns. The mean RMS values have shown a nearly constant but distinct averages for the only-extruder, only-table and extruder-table movements.},

   abstract = {The reliability and performance of additive manufacturing (AM) machines affect the product quality and manufacturing cost. Developing effective health monitoring and prognostics methods is critical to AM productivity. Yet limited work is done on machine health monitoring. Recently, the application of acoustic emission sensor (AE) to the fault diagnosis of material extrusion or fused deposition modeling process was demonstrated. One challenge in real-time process monitoring is processing the large amount of data collected by high-fidelity sensors for diagnostics and prognostics. In this paper, the efficiency of machine state identification from AE data is significantly improved with reduced feature space dimension. In the proposed method, features extracted in both time and frequency domains are combined and then reduced with the linear discriminant analysis. An unsupervised density based clustering method is applied to classify and recognize different machine states of the extruder. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively identify machine states of the extruder even within a much smaller feature space.},

   abstract = {In a previous work, dumbbell specimens were shown to be inadequate for the tensile testing of Additive Manufacturing monolayers. Finite Element Method (FEM) has been used in this contribution for comparing tensile-stress distributions in both conventional and rectangular samples. Different extrusion paths for the manufacturing via Fused Layer Modelling (FLM) were taken into account. The calculations showed stress concentrations in the dumbbell type specimens in the zone of variable width away from the gauge length. The results were used for explaining the differences between mechanical behavior of dumbbell and rectangular specimens made with FLM from Poly-Lactic Acid (PLA). The mechanical behavior in the experiments closely matches the FEM results. At least 20 % of the tested dumbbell specimens fractured away from the gauge length, compromising the resulting tensile strength data. Rectangular tensile test specimens are proposed as a better alternative.},

@article{Carmo2020,
   abstract = {The fused deposition modeling (FDM) process, commonly known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, deals with the manufacturing of parts by the subsequent addition of layers of fused plastic filament. The parts obtained during this process can be used for domestic applications, rapid prototyping, or final applications. During the preparation of the printing model (slicing), different process parameters must be defined, such as extruder speed, extruder height in relation to the bed, and bed temperature. Parameters that, if incorrectly defined, can lead to a series of deficiencies in the parts, such as low dimensional accuracy, low surface quality, reduced mechanical resistance, and, eventually, the occurrence of several printing defects in the parts, impairing or even preventing its use. The 3D printing process has a critical period at its beginning during the manufacturing of the piece’s first layer. The present work aims to study some of the geometric anomalies observed in monolayer pieces when some of the printing parameters are improperly defined. Printing tests on monolayer parts were carried out with a polylactic acid (PLA) filament. Herein, a home grade 3D printer, model Graber i3, was used. The height of the extruder to the bed was altered in relation to the recommended value, and three pieces were printed for each height used. The printed parts were scanned with a 1200 × 1200 dpi resolution, using a DCP-L2540DW model scanner. The images obtained were then analyzed using the Matlab® software and the geometric characteristics of the pieces were compared. The study is a first step towards a better understanding of the geometric defects obtained when an incorrect definition of basic parameters occurs when processing the three-dimensional model.},
