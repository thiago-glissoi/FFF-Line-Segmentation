   abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has been played a crucial role in the fourth industrial revolution. Sensor-based monitoring technologies are essential in detecting defects and providing feedback for process control. Acoustic emission (AE) sensors have been used for long time in a wide range of processes and fields, but they are still a challenge in AM processes. This work presents a study on the AE signals in the time-domain - raw and root mean square (RMS) values - regarding their behavior during the manufacturing of a single-layer part in the Fused Filament Fabrication process for two infill patterns. Tests were conducted in a Cartesian 3D printer using Polylactic Acid material. The AE sensor was attached to the printer table through a magnetic coupling, and the signal was collected by an oscilloscope at 1 MHz sampling frequency. It was found that the raw AE signals behaved quite differently not just for the two infill patterns, but within the same pattern. The raw and RMS AE signals contain many spikes along the whole process, but the higher ones were those generally occurring at the end and/or start of a fabrication line. The RMS values, however, was useful for finding the start and end times of each fabricated line for both patterns. The mean RMS values have shown a nearly constant but distinct averages for the only-extruder, only-table and extruder-table movements.},

   abstract = {The reliability and performance of additive manufacturing (AM) machines affect the product quality and manufacturing cost. Developing effective health monitoring and prognostics methods is critical to AM productivity. Yet limited work is done on machine health monitoring. Recently, the application of acoustic emission sensor (AE) to the fault diagnosis of material extrusion or fused deposition modeling process was demonstrated. One challenge in real-time process monitoring is processing the large amount of data collected by high-fidelity sensors for diagnostics and prognostics. In this paper, the efficiency of machine state identification from AE data is significantly improved with reduced feature space dimension. In the proposed method, features extracted in both time and frequency domains are combined and then reduced with the linear discriminant analysis. An unsupervised density based clustering method is applied to classify and recognize different machine states of the extruder. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively identify machine states of the extruder even within a much smaller feature space.},
